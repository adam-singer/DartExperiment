To run the code, open the Builder.dart file in the Dart Editor and press play.

This is a small physics experiment written in Dart to see how suitable the language is for game/graphics/physics programming.

The demo is an example of point-masses and stick-constraints using the verlet integration; Thomas Jakobsen's excellent article "Advanced Character Physics" introduced me to the concept and got me interested in physics programming several years ago.
